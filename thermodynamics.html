                    Thermodynamics is the study of the effects of work, heat, and energy on a system.
                    Thermodynamics is only concerned with large scale observations. In science 10 physics, we don't talk
                    very much about thermodynamics, however we do acknowledge 2 (out of 4) of the Laws of Thermodynamics.

                <h3 class="extrapadding2">
                    The First Law
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Energy can't be created or destroyed, but can be transformed/converted from one form to another or transferred from one 
                    object to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This law is also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy and is very simple. It states that there is a
                    finite amount of energy within the universe that, while it can be converted or transferred, you can't have more or less than what you already have.
                </p>
                <h3 class="extrapadding1">
                    The Second Law
                </h3>
                <p>
                    No process can be 100% efficient, some energy will always be lost, usually as thermal energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This law is also known as entropy, and is also very simple to understand. 
                </p>
                <p class="extrapadding2">
                    It should be noted that in Science 10, you will always consider forces like friction and air resistant as non-existant, and
                    will believe that almost every, if not every, process is 100% efficient despite the second law of thermodynamics.
