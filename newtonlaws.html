                        Sir Isaac Newton (see right) was an English physicist and mathemetician born December 25, 1642 in Lincolnshire. During the 17th century, 
                        Newton managed to become a culminating figure of the scientific revolution. He was able to make new and exciting discoveries which revolutionized
                        17th century civilization's understanding of science in areas like optics, mathematics, and mechanics. His discovery in mechanics have become the basic
                        principles of modern physics, and has resulted in the creation of new discoveries (the law of universal gravitation). You may be asking, what was this
                        massive discovery in mechanics that is fundamental to physics today? Well, if you read the title, it should be obvious that this amazing discovery is known
                        as <span class="underline">Newton's Three Laws of Motion</span> or just simply <span class="underline">Newton's Laws</span>. So now you might 
                        be thinking to yourself: what are these laws?
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="extrapadding2">
                        The First Law
                    </h3>
                    <p class="lawpara">
                        An object will continue moving at a constant velocity (include v = 0) in the absense of an unbalanced force.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lawpara">
                        This law is basically just talking about the phenomenon known as inertia, the tendency to do nothing or remain unchanged unless it is acted upon.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="extrapadding1">
                        The Second Law
                    </h3>
                    <p class="lawpara">
                        Acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the magnitude of the 
                        net unbalance force and is inversly proportional to the object's mass.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lawpara">
                        Now, this law may sound a bit complicated to you, but it really isn't very complicated. Simply put, this law just states
                        that Force is equal to Mass x Acceleration or F=ma.
                    </p>
                    <p class="extrapadding1">
                        Last but not least, 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="extrapadding1">
                        The Third Law
                    </h3>
                    <p class="lawpara">
                        For every action force there is a reaction force of equal magnitude, acting in the opposite direction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lawpara">
                        This is a law almost everyone has become acquainted with, its the reason you feel recoil when you fire a gun, 
                        the reason why a rocket can launch, and the reason why a ball bounces.
